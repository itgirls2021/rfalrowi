        <h2> Machine learning </h2>

          Have you ever been surfing the web and all of a sudden you see an ad about something you showed interest in before? The answer is most likely yes.
          Your probably wondering why that is, well that’s exactly what we are going to talk about.
          First off how dose your Device know what to recommend for you. It’s due to machine learning.

        <h2> what is Machine learning  </h2>
        <p>
             Machine learning takes any kind of data and starts to recognize patterns in the data and ultimately makes decisions without being programmed. Like speech Recognition. I’m sure many if not all of you used it before. Your device take the data (that is your speech) and process it into written text.

             I pretty much search everything on the internet. So I’m always recommended many things whether It’s an ad for a bag I liked on an app like Instagram or YouTube. Or it could be a website I might be interested in, maybe a YouTube video. Now those recommendations may be wrong as a result of bias.
             Bias is when a machine is influenced in an unfair way either intentionally or not.

        <p>
          However there are ways that unfairness can be addressed. First things first make sure your data is complete, if your data is complete than the bias is probably caused by humans. Here are some measures that can be taken to help.
          First ask yourself two question. One, if you have collected enough data to accurately train your computer. Two, is this data being inclusive of all possible scenarios and users.
          Second you should have a full understanding of the algorithms and data.
          Third you should come up with a debiasing way.

        <h2> My Teachable machine model </h2>
        <p>
          In class we where asked to create a model using a teachable machine. Me and a couple of amazing girls were paired together, we got to working and thought of a great idea to use for our teachable machine.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We collected photos of foods that were relatively similar, like regular gummy bears and organic gummy bears, a normal cheeseburger and a veggie burger, dairy free ice cream and ice cream that has dairy in it. Then we trained our machine to tell them apart so when you show it a picture of a burger it will tell you whether it’s veggie burger or a cheeseburger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this model is to help you make better decisions no matter the reason. You might be allergic to some foods, you could be lactose intolerant, or overall just trying to be healthy and get fit. Either way this machine got your back.
