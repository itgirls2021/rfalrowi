        <h2> Cryptography: its Impact and importance.  </h2>
        <p> Reem Alrowili / July 25th, 2021 </p>
        <P>
             Cryptography is a huge part of our lives. It affects us in many ways, in order to understand how it affects us we must understand how it works and what it is.
             Cryptography can be defined as: transforming a plaintext into a cipher that can only be decrypted with a key.
             It’s a process that involves storing and transferring data in a way that only allows the person it is meant for to read.

        <h2> How has Cryptography made Every day activities safer. </h2>
        <p>
             Cryptography has made my life much easier, The use of it is everywhere. It prevents criminals from reading my communications and possibly stealing money or leaking private information, as it provides safety to its best.
             The modern world fundamentally relies on cryptography. Encryption makes many things in our everyday lives possible by adding confidentiality, like making a phone call, buying something with a credit card and online payments, such as apple pay.

        <h2> Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptography.</h2>
        <p> 
             Like everything else cryptography has it’s advantages and disadvantages. Whether it’s positive or negative depends on how and why you use it.  
        </p>
        <p>
             Firstly Let’s highlight some of the positives of cryptography.
             a cryptanalyst/codebreaker by the name of Elizebeth s. Friedman alongside her husband William f. Friedman were responsible of directing an unofficial code-breaking team that was hired by the national Government, during world war I. She has also managed to decrypt codes used by well-known criminals and bring them down.
             Another advantage of cryptography is keeping important information Secure. For instance, your credit card information, your phone calls, and the list goes on.

             Now Here’s how using it can be negative.
             When it’s used by criminals to encrypt their communication in order to avoid being incriminate, much the same as the high- profile criminals elizebeth friedman took down.
             Cryptography can be very time consuming as well. it could be a while before your able to crack the code, or Even create the code.
            
        </p>
        <p>
             Finally to sum up everything, we can safely say that cryptography is a prominent part of our lives. 
             Had it not existed our lives would be much different than what it is right now. We just have to be careful due to the fact that it can be vulnerable if it's not done or being used right.

              Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.
