        <h2> Cryptography: its Impact and importance.  </h2>
        <p> Reem Alrowili / July 25th, 2021 </p>
        <P>
             Cryptography is a huge part of our lives. It affects us in many ways, in order to understand how it affects us we must understand how it works and what it is.
             Cryptography can be defined as: transforming a plaintext into a cipher that can only be decrypted with a key.
             It’s a process that involves storing and transferring data in a way that only allows the person it is meant for to read.

        <h2> How has Cryptography made Every day activities safer. </h2>
        <p>
             Cryptography has made my life much easier, The use of it is everywhere. It prevents criminals from reading my communications and possibly stealing money or leaking private information, as it provides safety to its best.
             The modern world fundamentally relies on cryptography. Encryption makes many things in our everyday lives possible by adding confidentiality, like making a phone call, buying something with a credit card and online payments, such as apple pay.

        <h2> Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptography.</h2>
        <p> 
             Like everything else cryptography has it’s advantages and disadvantages. Whether it’s positive or negative depends on how and why you use it.  
        </p>
        <p>
             Firstly Let’s highlight some of the positives of cryptography.
             a cryptanalyst/codebreaker by the name of Elizebeth s. Friedman alongside her husband William f. Friedman were responsible of directing an unofficial code-breaking team that was hired by the national Government, during world war I. She has also managed to decrypt codes used by well-known criminals and bring them down.
             Another advantage of cryptography is keeping important information Secure. For instance, your credit card information, your phone calls, and the list goes on.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
             Now Here’s how using it can be negative.
             When it’s used by criminals to encrypt their communication in order to avoid being incriminate, much the same as the high- profile criminals elizebeth friedman took down.
             Cryptography can be very time consuming as well. it could be a while before your able to crack the code, or Even create the code.
            
        </p>
        <p>
             Finally to sum up everything, we can safely say that cryptography is a prominent part of our lives. 
             Had it not existed our lives would be much different than what it is right now. We just have to be careful due to the fact that it can be vulnerable if it's not done or being used right.

              Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.

        <h1> Machine learning </h1>
        <p> Reem Alrowili / july 26th, 2021</p>
        <p>
          Have you ever been surfing the web and all of a sudden you see an ad about something you showed interest in before? The answer is most likely yes.
          Your probably wondering why that is, well that’s exactly what we are going to talk about.
          First off how dose your Device know what to recommend for you. It’s due to machine learning.  
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> what is Machine learning  </h2>
        <p>
             Machine learning takes any kind of data and starts to recognize patterns in the data and ultimately makes decisions without being programmed. Like speech Recognition. I’m sure many if not all of you used it before. Your device take the data (that is your speech) and process it into written text.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
             I pretty much search everything on the internet. So I’m always recommended many things whether It’s an ad for a bag I liked on an app like Instagram or YouTube. Or it could be a website I might be interested in, maybe a YouTube video. Now those recommendations may be wrong as a result of bias.
             Bias is when a machine is influenced in an unfair way either intentionally or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          However there are ways that unfairness can be addressed. First things first make sure your data is complete, if your data is complete than the bias is probably caused by humans. Here are some measures that can be taken to help.
          First ask yourself two question. One, if you have collected enough data to accurately train your computer. Two, is this data being inclusive of all possible scenarios and users.
          Second you should have a full understanding of the algorithms and data.
          Third you should come up with a debiasing way.          
        </p>

        <h2> My Teachable machine model </h2>
        <p>
          In class we where asked to create a model using a teachable machine. Me and a couple of amazing girls were paired together, we got to working and thought of a great idea to use for our teachable machine.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We collected photos of foods that were relatively similar, like regular gummy bears and organic gummy bears, a normal cheeseburger and a veggie burger, dairy free ice cream and ice cream that has dairy in it. Then we trained our machine to tell them apart so when you show it a picture of a burger it will tell you whether it’s veggie burger or a cheeseburger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this model is to help you make better decisions no matter the reason. You might be allergic to some foods, you could be lactose intolerant, or overall just trying to be healthy and get fit. Either way this machine got your back.
