      <p>
        Hello everyone! I’m Reem,
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>I’m a 2021 High school graduate</strong>, I graduated back in May in Saudi Arabia. I have always loved IT and Computer science, almost every one of my siblings pursued a career in computer science so I basically grew up with it being a huge part of my life. when I saw this course I was so so excited to join and be with my peers. I’m most interested about cyber security and programming.

        One of my favorite hobbies is reading, I’ve read many books but jojo moyes’s book “me before you” was absolutely amazing. I loved the movie too! It’s hard to say what my favorite movie is I have so many, but my favorite genres are comedy and action. I started watching Grey’s Anatomy a while back it’s such a great show, so far I’m on Season 13.
        I’m also working on my Digital drawing and animation it’s so much fun, and I’ve gotten good at it.
